1. What is monitoring

The process of obeserving and checking the quality and progress of something over a period of time under a systematic review
imagine like watching a bitcoin graph for 1 hr saying how its rising...its rising percent so on.

2.why do we monitor
To better serve our business
say we have 5 servers out which 4 performs well one doesnt so we can find and sort the things so we will have good outcome right

problem detection
before running into downtime we can find what is the issue
Trouble shoot active problems
Through monitoring we can find where the exact active issue is and then sort it
Reporting and Observation
Help us to know more about memory utilization and cpu utilization


3. what to monitor
see cannot pretty much monitor everything and getting millions of alerts
it depends on business process
say if we are working with machines we have to monitor those
Incase of servers
we will go for workload.. availability and faults and errors
Incase of any resources.. we go for memory utilization so on

4. what is nagios core
It is a open source enterprise monitoring tool. Through which we can monitor things ranging from OS to temperature.
This is possible because of the plugins inside nagios
Nagios server (The place where all the data and status of the device montior gets stored) can be installed only on to the LINUX os. 
Whereas we can monitor windows and others using a nagios agent

5. what are feature os nagios core
monitoring host resources like cpu usage, memory, so on
It has an active community with 5843 plugins in 458 categories
It can do parralel checking that is many checks at single time
It also helps in finding hierarchy. Which device or service is dependent on which one
helps in send Email and notification


6. Why we need nagios
helps in finding problems in all types of network
helps in solving the problem before it goes into downtime
helps in solving root problem of the cause
helps in solving problems automatically
helps to upgrade any service if its going to get deprecated

see nagios core is more like a react.js its simply an engine ... it need lot of components to run a thing
whereas nagios xi is more like angular. It simply has many things attached to it


7. nagios architecture
  nagios server
          |
  nagios process scheduler
          |
      Plugins (check_nrp, check_snmp)
          

say if we wanna monitor local windows machine what it does is ... we will install nagios agent onto the local windows machine...so these nagios plugins call
plugins to execute...The plugins from nagios grab the status of the local windows device and the result will be sent back to the nagios...The nagios process scheduler will
check the status of the device incase if there is any status change what it does is it will notify us...This information will be further stored on to the .rrd database



//

8.Terminology

Plugins
These are external programs that consist of scripts that can be executed...helps in getting the status of the host device

Host
Any server which we want to monitor

Service
Any thing like cpu utilization...usage..so on metric

user
The one who can access the web interface

contact
If there is any issue...The email or notifications will be sent to them

contact group
Say there is multiple contact for same service (lx users) we will group them into one so that everyone receives same alerts

resolution team
Group of IT personalle who is responsible for finding, diagnosing and resolving the alert

Basically both are for managing alert and notification but they slightly differ onto there purpose

acknowledgement
Say if there has been an alert any induvidual can acknowledge and letting others know that alert is being worked on.

Downtime
say there is any system updation or any service related upgradation we well go for downtime

latency
The difference between schedule to runtime and actual runtime is called as latency

state - two state soft and hard basically to avoid false positive 

agents
The services that must be placed onto a client that received the status of the device...We saw that in our old example

host group
grouping the host in to groups on the basis of say place (US servers so on)

service group
we can group multiple groups together based on similarity



9.checks in nagios
we have 2 kinds of checks

It depends on the network connectivity between host and agent

active check
say we want cpu utilization from the host

nagios server 
      |
check command
      |
cpu utilization plugin


see basically nagios server has check command when it executes plugins for cpu utilization on the agent so that we will be with cpu utilzation status
This is called active check

say I am using a external application like a chrome when its running the status of the chrome every certain time will be stored in external command file...then 
external command logic will grab that and provides to check logic this is then submitted to nagios server for the processing

This is called passive checks


10. Hard and soft states
Say there is an status critical and there is a latency of 5 minutes so despite there is no error what nagios does is its simply ends error again and again
This is a scenario for false positive alerts

if the status change from previos state to current state we call it state change

say there is a server
10:0:0:5
the check is done but shows ok its in hard state now, also next state change is 10:0:5:5

but sadly its down by 10:0:3:5

nagios doesnt know its down coz it hasn't checked anything

by 10:0:5:5
when nagios checks the status is critical also the state is now soft now it goes for retry check interval with attempt one the retry check_interval : 1 min attempt 1/3

by 10:0:6:5
status - critical
state - soft
attempt - 2/3

by 10:0:7:5
status - critical
state - hard since it reached maximum retry amount it changes to hard state and notification will be sent to 
attempt - 3/3

by 10:0:10:5 = There will be next check and continues like 10:0:15:5

but based on configuration another notification will be sent in 120 mins or whatever time we want

so it 
hard ok -> soft critical (tries 3 attempts) -> hard critical



//

These are centos/linux commands
sestatus - to know the status of the selinux whether the protection is disabled or not
sudo yum update -y - updates everything 
sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config - using sed to change the selinux file
setenforce 0 changes the activve -> permissive

systemctl stop firewalld - to stop firewall
systemctl mask firewalld - to mask firewall
systemctl unmask firewalld - to unmask firewall
systemctl start firewalld - to start firewall

firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https



/* There goes important necessary download commands for this */

user dashboard walkthrough

how to start a dashboard <ipaddress>/nagios


DAEMON running says that what is the ID of the nagios instance we running

shows current installed version
The date when it got last updated


Tactical overview
where you can see everything onto a single page
like host health and its progress and stuffs

we can click on the induvidual status to know how many services whether they are up or down so on

we can even get the any host or services if they are outraged

Monitoring features help us to know whether we are enabling notifications or not for a particular service even we can 
find active passive as well as event monitoring checks can be easily found out


Map

its helping us  in visualization of host and services connected to us
using this what we can do is there is a hamburger menu on top of it to align in whatever way we want it

Host
This gives the list of all the host that are under monitoring

service
This gives the list of all services under monitoring

Host group
This gives the list of all host group under monitoring

Grid
Gives the grid view of the monitored host / services based on our wishes

Availability report
say if we want to the percent of up time in past 8 days what we can do is we can get those things from availability report

Trends
This gives a visual representation of group like the total time when it was up and total time when it was down so on

Alerts
This gives us what all are the available alerts so on
everything related to alerts and notification or more or less same 


comments
They are used for acknowledging whether we are running it or working on the host/service
we can go to comments
under there will be an option to give a comment where we can simply give it...This comment will be visible to anyone who has access

downtime
For scheduling downtime we should pick up a host then at the right there will be an option for downtime

process info
This is totally related to nagios core...whether notification enabled are we able to see things and stuffs so on

performance info 
This is related to nagios how many active checks are going on at what time checks are done so on everything like thta

scheduling queue

At what time whatt is going to checked so on

configuration

whether things are enabled or disabled so and so

Post installation tasks

see say if directly start adding host/ services...we may overcome some issue with format of nagios...inorder to avoid those issues
There are quite a lot of postinstallation task

create contact and contact groups-
Though we can add it later its better to create contact and contact group

creat HOST
if we create on Host group ... Jst using that same template we can create other host too

create SERVICES
lly for services

plugins
at first there will be only set of plugins incase if we wanna add kubernetes monitoring so on we have to download the specific plugins

create and define the time periods

create required directories /usr/local/nagios and add to cfg...this reduces the error from creating a file somewhere and moving it to here

for graphs and any other visualization tool what we can do is we can install necessary things so that we dont overcome any error


//
UNDERSTANDING TEMPLATE

define host{
    name         linux-shaam (The name of the host which we specify)
    check_period    24*7 (how we wanna monitor this host)
    check_interval   5 (for how many minutes once you wanna check this host)
    retry_interval   1 (incase if the host is down for how many minutes once you wanna check this host)
    max_check_attempts  10 (what is the maximum amount of time you should check this host before sending notification)
    check_command     check_host_alive (what we are monitoring this for ...This name should be there in check_command.cfg)
    notification_interval  120 (at what time you want to get notification after first notfication)
    notification_options   d,u,r(down, unknown, recovered)
    contact_group    LB_Linux (who wanna receive notification when host is down)
    icon_image, status  found in logos just gives us what image should be visible say linux windows for ui purpose 
    action_url      shows graph (need to install pnp4nachios) /pnp4nagios/index.php/graph?host=$HOSTNAME$
    notification_enabled   1 (yes it should send notification)
    flap_detection_enable  1 (whether it goes up and down simultaneously)
    process_perf_data     1 (whether we want process performance data)
    event_handler_enabled  1 
    retain_status_information  1
    retain_nonstatus_information 1
    notification_period   24*7
    register            0
